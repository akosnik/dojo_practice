// start at 2 and add it to the next number
// check if they equal 26
// if they are
//  output the numbers that are equal to nine 26 by location
// if they aren't
//  continue with 2 and move 7 forward to 11
//  keep moving forward to the end of the array
// set our control 2 to the next number 7
// if 7 plus 11 equals target
//  if they are
//    output the numbers that are equal to nine 26 by location
// if they aren't
//  continue with 2 and move 7 forward to 11
//  keep moving forward to the end of the array
// set our control 2 to the next number 7

// if we never find anything equal to target
//  return no match found

// use concrete examples
// don't wory too much about details like where you start and end your loops
