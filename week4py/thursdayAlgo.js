// longestPalindrome(str) -> input is a string
// output is the longest palindrome contained within that string
// if you find multiple palindromes of the same length, return the first one
// that you find
// "ehjgkkgeh" -> "gkkg"
// "ehjg kkgeh" -> "kk"
// "qwertttreqwerewy" -> "ertttre"
// "qwerttttttreqwerewy" -> "erttttttre"
// "abacabd" -> "bacab"
// "abacaed" -> "aba"
// "abcde" -> "a" (every character is effectively its own palindrome)
// "a" -> "a" (lol)
// "racecar" -> "racecar" (no need to use the previous function if you don't want to)
// "I like to drive the racecar extremely fast" -> "e racecar e"
